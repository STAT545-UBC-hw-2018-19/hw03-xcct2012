## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
 
 # STAT 545 Homework Assignment 3
 ## Zachary Sherker
 # Overview
 
 In this assignment I will perform the following tasks:
 
-Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

-Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years.

-Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.

 
 I will first upload gapminder data set, tidy verse, and `knitr` and `reshape 2` packages.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)

```
 #  Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.
 I start by grouping the gapminder dataset by continent and use the summarize function to find max and min GDP per capita values.
```{r}
group_by(gapminder,continent) %>%
  summarize(max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap),min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap))
```
```{r}
a<- group_by(gapminder,continent) %>%
  summarize(max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap),min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap))
```
 
 
 I will then visualize and compare the min and max GDP per cap of each continent using a bar graph.
```{r}
b<-melt(a,id=c("continent"))
ggplot(b,aes(x=continent,y=value,fill=variable))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity")+scale_y_log10()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14,hjust=0.5))+
  labs(x="continent",
       y="GDPpercapita_logscale",
       title="max & min GDP per capita per continent")
```
 # Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.
 For this analysis I have trimmed the life expectancy of the various years by one standard deviation.
```{r}
group_by(gapminder,year)%>%
  filter(lifeExp > (mean(lifeExp)-sd(lifeExp)) & 
         lifeExp < (mean(lifeExp)+sd(lifeExp)))%>% 
         summarize(mean_lifeExp=mean(lifeExp),
                   median_lifeExp=median(lifeExp),
                   sd_lifeExp=sd(lifeExp))
```
 I then visualize the trimmed data set through a histogram to see the distribution of life expectancy by country over time from 1952-2007.
```{r}
group_by(gapminder,year)%>%
  filter(lifeExp > (mean(lifeExp)-sd(lifeExp)) & 
         lifeExp < (mean(lifeExp)+sd(lifeExp)))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=lifeExp))+
  geom_histogram(fill='green',alpha=0.25)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14,hjust=0.5))+
  labs(x="life expectancy",
       y="number of countries",
       title="Global distribution of life expectancy from 1952 to 2007")
```
 # Report the absolute abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent
 I first calculate the global low life expectancy (low life exp = average life exp - the SD of life exp) for each year.
```{r}
group_by(gapminder,year)%>%
  summarize(low_life_expectancy=mean(lifeExp)-sd(lifeExp))%>%kable()
```
 I then calculate the number of countries with low life expectancy in each year.
```{r}
c<-group_by(gapminder,year)%>%
  mutate(lowLifeExp=mean(lifeExp)-sd(lifeExp)) 
group_by(c,continent,year)%>%
  summarize(Total_lowLifeExp=sum(lifeExp<lowLifeExp))
```
```{r}
d<- group_by(c,continent,year)%>%
  summarize(numBelowLowLifeExp=sum(lifeExp<lowLifeExp))
```
 
 I then used a scatterplot to visualize the number of countries with low life expectancy in each continent per year.
```{r}
ggplot(d,aes(x=year,y=numBelowLowLifeExp))+
  geom_point(color='purple',alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2010, 20),
                     labels = as.character(seq(1950, 2010, 20)),
                     limits = c(1950, 2010))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(size=14,hjust=0.5))+
  labs(x="year",
       y="# countries below low life expectancy",
       title="Number of countries with low life expectancy per continent over time")
```
