This is a repository for Zachary Sherker's STAT545 homework 3 assignment.
In this assignment, I use `ggplot` and `tidyverse` to explore and visualize the following aspects of the `gapminder` dataset:

-Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

-Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years.

-Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.
